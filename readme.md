# Project - 2048
## Description
The objective of the game is to create the 2048 tile by combining tiles with the same number.
The tiles are multiples of 2, every turn a new tile is generated (STILL IN DEV).
## Status
Under Development
## Dependencies
*NOTE: Pygame can be extremely finicky, I have gotten Pygame to work on Python v3.7.7 on MacOS*  
  
This program uses Pygame, follow the instructions below to set up venv:

1. Create the virtual environment using python3's venv command
    >$python3 -m venv /example/path/destination/venv
    - Make sure to include /venv at the end in order to package the environment in a single directory
2. Navigate to the directory containing /venv
    >$cd /example/path/destination
3. Activate the virtual envornment by calling the 'activate' script
    >$source venv/bin/activate
4. Install dependencies using the included requirements file
    >$pip install -r requirements.txt
